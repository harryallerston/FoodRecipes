Chilli
======




Ingredients
-----------

Serves 4

* 400g mince 
* 1 large onion (diced)
* 1 clove of garlic
* 2 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp chilli powder
* 3 pinches of dried chilli flakes
* 1 tsp paprika
* 2 tins of tomatoes: (drain one tin so there's not too much liquid)
* 1/2 a box of mushrooms
* 1 tin of kidney beans in chilli sauce (don't drain them, use the sauce!)
* tbsp of worcestershire sauce



Preparation
-----------

1. Fry onions and garlic until soft
2. Add mince, cumin, chilli powder etc. and fry until mince is brown
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for around an hour
4. Season and thicken with flour if needed


_Works well in the slow cooker too_ : do step 2 then chuck the rest in all day.
