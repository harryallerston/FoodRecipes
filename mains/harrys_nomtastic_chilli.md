Serves 4

* 400g mince 
* 1 large red onion (diced)
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 4 tsp ground cumin
* 2 tsp chilli powder
* 3 pinches of dried chilli flakes
* 2 tsp paprika
* 2 tins of tomatoes: (drain one tin so there's not too much liquid)
* 1/2 a box of mushrooms
* 1 tin of kidney beans in chilli sauce (don't drain them, use the sauce!)
* tbsp of worcestershire sauce
* dash of reggae reggae sauce
* glass of red wine (if feeling fancy)
* grated cheese for topping

for the rice:

* basmati rice
* 2 tsp turmeric
* pinch of salt


Preparation
-----------

1. Fry onions and garlic until soft
2. Add mince, cumin, chilli powder etc. and fry until mince is brown
3. Add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for around an hour
4. Season and thicken with flour if needed
5. when cooking the rice, add turmeric and a pinch of salt to the water whilst simmering


_Works well in the slow cooker too_ : do step 2 then chuck the rest in all day.
