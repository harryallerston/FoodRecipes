# Cadbury's Creme Egg Brownies

##Ingredients
- 185g unsalted butter 
- 185g best dark chocolate 
- 85g plain flour 
- 40g cocoa powder 
- 3 large eggs 
- 275g golden caster sugar
- 6 Cadburyâ€™s Creme eggs cut in half.

## Preparation / cooking
1. Preheat the oven to 160C and grease a 20 cm square baking tin. 
2. Melt the butter and dark chocolate together either in the microwave or in a bowl over boiling water.
3. Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar until they look thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes. You will know it's ready when the mixture becomes really pale and about double its original volume.
4. Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, and then gently fold together.
5. Hold a sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and sift the cocoa and flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly. Gently fold in to the mixture.
6. Pour into the baking tin and cook for 15 minutes then take out of the over and gently press the Cadburys creme egg halves into the mix, spacing them apart evenly. Put back in the over for another 5-10 minutes.
7. Leave to cool before removing from tin and cutting into squares.
